# reactrouter

SPA
Traditionally a website requires a trip to the server to fetch a web page when a user clicks on a link.  
React Single Page Application sends the complete web application to a browser where the individual componenets are rendered into navigable web pages using React Router DOM package. 
When you click on a link, the browser renders the page rather than requesting another page from the server. 

```npx create-react-app sitter

`public/` : public facing files go here like index.html, css, images etc

`src/` : here we can create our components. 
- App.js will render the default page that react gives us
- index.js : what we use to insert the rendered js into the index.html

**react-router-dom** : package needed to have navigation occur within our react app
